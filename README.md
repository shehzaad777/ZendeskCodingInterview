Hey there! Hope you enjoy the ticket viewer. 

HOW TO USE:

First things first, some packages will need to be installed, they are listed as follows:
1. typing (can be installed using pip, I believe the command is pip3 install typing , if running pip3)
2. unittest (can be installed using pip, I believe the command is pip3 install unittest , if running pip3), you will specifically need the mock module
3. datetime (can be installed using pip, I believe the command is pip3 install datetime , if running pip3)

NOTE: Sometimes IDEs or even OSs act differently when installing modules so please install as per your computer requirements, I provided the pip command as a 
general guideline but the installation can be done by most IDEs.

NEXT:
Great, now that the hard part is done, all you need to do is navigate to the file named main.py and run that file. That will start the program and the rest of the 
information is in the program including the valid prompts. You will be asked to give a subdomain and some credentials when first running the program.
For tests, navigate to the main_tester.py file and run that. There aren't too many tests but I've live tested a lot. 

That's all! Have fun and I hope to hear back!
